 Project Proposal: Snake Game Design and Development

 Objective
To design and implement a modular and interactive Snake game using object-oriented programming principles, emphasizing clean design, scalability, and user engagement.

# Scope
1. Core Features:
    Snake Movement: Controlled by arrow keys, dynamically updating the position.
    Food Generation: Randomly placed red and black food to increase score and grow the snake.
    Obstacles: Randomly moving obstacles to challenge the player.
    Collision Detection:** For boundaries, snake's body, food, and obstacles.

2. Classes:
   Snake Class: Manages snake properties like position, length, and growth.
   Game Class: Oversees game state, score, food, obstacles, and overall logic.

Deliverables
 A functional Snake game with a clear interface.
 Documentation explaining the design and methods.
 Testing reports ensuring functionality and stability.

Timeline
 Week 1: Requirement analysis and class structure design.
 Week 2: Development of `Snake` and `Game` classes.
 Week 3: Integration, testing, and debugging.
 Week 4: Final presentation and documentation.

 Expected Outcome
A fully functional, engaging Snake game that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and highlights efficient, modular coding practices.
